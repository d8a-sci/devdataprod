# Course Project for Developing Data Products course 

## Usage

There are two directories (folders):

1. `shiny`
1. `rpres`

In `shiny` you find the sources for the Shiny app as deployed on the `shinyapps.io` website. 
> [Fuel economy surveyor](https://d8a-sci.shinyapps.io/fuelsurvey)

In `rpres` you find the sources for the presentation as published on the `RPubs` website. 
> [Fuel economy surveyor presentation](https://rpubs.com/d8a-sci/112007)


## Notes

The (hyper-)links within the presentation try to open within the presentation. It's best to use a modifier key
(option, alt) when clicking the link, or use the contextual menu to open the link in a new window.
